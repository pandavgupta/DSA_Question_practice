       question : split array largest sum

       binary seach on answer : here it is sum 
       7 2 5 10 8
minimum           maxmium sum
sum

* in minimum we have atleast one element so minimum sum = 10
* in maxmium sum is sum of all element : 32

mid will calculated using their division, let say in this example we 
  have to split into 2 part , m = 2
  so mid = (min+ max)/m;

  mid = (10+32)/2
   maxmium mid can be 21 in the array.

   can we check if there is 2 subarray possible if sum of each sum array is 21.
